# Password Cracking Tool
### This Python script is a simple implementation of a brute-force attack that attempts to crack various types of password hashes.
### The script prompts the user to enter the length of the password and select an option to enter password hashes manually or import them from a file. It then generates ### all possible password guesses of the specified length and compares their hashes to the provided password hashes. If a match is found, the script prints out the original password.
### In summary, this script is a tool that demonstrates how a brute-force attack can be carried out to crack passwords.
